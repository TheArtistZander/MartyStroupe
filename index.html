<h2>About</h2>
<div class="about-text">
  <p>
    Marty Stroupe is a European-born actress, model, and musician whose work bridges stage and screen with warmth, wit, and curiosity. Educated in theatre and musical performance, she built her foundation in live performance—where timing, emotion, and presence are everything.
  </p>
  <p>
    That early stage training still shapes her screen work today, bringing depth and authenticity to even the most understated moments. A multilingual and multi-talented performer, Marty moves comfortably between cultures and genres. She's as at home delivering grounded, intimate drama as she is leaning into the playful absurdity of comedy.
  </p>
  <p>
    Her own dark-comedy short film, <em>The Marketplace</em>, reflects that love of offbeat storytelling. As both a performer and a creator, she's drawn to projects that find humanity in the unexpected.
  </p>
  <p>
    Outside of acting, Marty is also a musician, a trained vocalist, and a lifelong mover—a certified yoga and fitness instructor whose stage presence and physical awareness come naturally.
  </p>
  <p>
    Her work—whether in front of a camera, behind a microphone, or on a stage—is all about connection: telling stories that feel alive, honest, and just a little bit surprising.
